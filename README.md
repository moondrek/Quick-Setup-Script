ESlint and Prettier recommend (or enforce) using local installations rather than global installations.

While I don't mind having local installations set up, and in some cases this is rather useful (like only having React linters in React libraries), I got rather sick of remembering to install and configure everything every time.

This shell script should do this automatically, in any npm-initialized directory!
